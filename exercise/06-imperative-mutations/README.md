# 06. Imperative Mutations

## Background

TODO: write some explanation to make this self-paced

## Exercise

Because this app deals with financial and customer data, we don't want anyone snooping if a user leaves their computer unattended. So we want to log the user out after a time.

We've already got the modal and logic around the timeout implemented for you. Your job is the Remix bit (of course). You need to post to the `/logout` route to get the user logged out.
