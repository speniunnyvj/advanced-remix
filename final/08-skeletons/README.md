# 10. Finished

## Background

TODO: write some explanation to make this self-paced

## Exercise

When we're on the customer page navigating between customers, we want to show a skeleton UI instead of just the spinner in the corner to improve the UX. We've already built a skeleton component for you. Your job is to use `useTransition().pathname` to determine which customer we're transitioning to and display the skeleton component while we load the rest of the data.
