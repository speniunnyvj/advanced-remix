# 02. Optimistic UI

## Background

TODO: write some explanation to make this self-paced

## Exercise

Let's make the deposit form optimistically list the new deposit the user just submitted. After all, all the data we need to display the new deposit is right there. The user just gave it to us!

- `amount`
- `depositDateFormatted` (we can get that from `depositDate.toLocalDateString()`)

## Files

- `app/routes/__app/sales/invoices/$invoiceId.tsx`
