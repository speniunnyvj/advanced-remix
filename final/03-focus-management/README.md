# 03. Focus Management

## Background

TODO: write some explanation to make this self-paced

## Exercise

Someone came through and added display error messages for us (how nice of them). But our focus management could definitely be better. Here's what we want to have happen on the new deposits form:

1. If there's an error, focus on the element that's in error (if there are multiple, just focus on the first one)
2. If there's no error, focus on the first input element
